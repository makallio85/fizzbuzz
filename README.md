# Fizz buzz
My first python script (and php-version also to compare speed). I did run those scripts in console and saw some difference in performance.

PHP
- It took 0 milliseconds to run 10 rounds in Fizz buzz game.
- It took 0 milliseconds to run 100 rounds in Fizz buzz game.
- It took 0 milliseconds to run 1000 rounds in Fizz buzz game.
- It took 2 milliseconds to run 10000 rounds in Fizz buzz game.
- It took 20 milliseconds to run 100000 rounds in Fizz buzz game.
- It took 203 milliseconds to run 1000000 rounds in Fizz buzz game.
- It took 2032 milliseconds to run 10000000 rounds in Fizz buzz game.

PYTHON
- It took 0 milliseconds to run 10 rounds in Fizz buzz game.
- It took 0 milliseconds to run 100 rounds in Fizz buzz game.
- It took 1 milliseconds to run 1000 rounds in Fizz buzz game.
- It took 3 milliseconds to run 10000 rounds in Fizz buzz game.
- It took 36 milliseconds to run 100000 rounds in Fizz buzz game.
- It took 362 milliseconds to run 1000000 rounds in Fizz buzz game.
- It took 3632 milliseconds to run 10000000 rounds in Fizz buzz game.

It seems that python is some reason little bit slower.
